# People Detection and Counting at Bus Stops using YOLOv5

## General Overview to Project

In the globalizing world, the population of people is increasing day by day. These increases also cause some transportation problems. The first of these is buses used by almost everyone. Every day, millions of people waste their time waiting at bus stops. In this scenario, we propose a solution to decrease the waiting time of people by using object detection algorithms. In this project, we will show how to obtain the data and what can be done with that data to solve this problem. We trained YOLOv5 with COCO data and processed the image inputs with the YOLOv5 object detection library to get the total count of people waiting at bus stops. This demonstrates that this solution is applicable and feasible with the help of cameras placed at bus stops. In the future, this idea can be used to decrease the waiting time of people at bus stops.
